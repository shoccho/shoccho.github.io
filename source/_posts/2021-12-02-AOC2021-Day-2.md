Let's continue our journey through learning rust while solving the advent of code puzzles. Let's tackle day 2 (wow even I am surprised that I am continuing to write this)

# Problem of Day 2
 
We are in a submarine which moves around following some instructions (our input)
 
The sample input looks like this
 
```
forward 5
down 5
forward 8
up 3
down 8
forward 2
```
Now for puzzle one we just need to simulate the submarine's action and find out where it will be at the end.
 
Logic of the submarine:
  * `forward X`  increases the horizontal position by X units.
  * `down X`     increases the depth by X units.
  * `up X`       decreases the depth by X units.

## Part 1
Here is my first approach
save x and y positions in two variables. Then traverse through the commands and update the x,y variables according to the submarine logic.
```
fn main(){
  let lines = include_str!("input").lines();
  let mut x :i32=0;
  let mut y :i32=0;
  for line in lines{
     let mut tokens = line.split(' ');
     let command =tokens.next().unwrap();
     let val = tokens.next().unwrap().parse::<i32>().unwrap();
     if command =="forward"{
        x+=val;
     }else if command =="up"{
        y-=val;
     }else if command =="down"{
        y+=val;
     }
  }
  println!("{}",x*y);
}
```
Pretty shitty code but hey it produces correct output for puzzle1.
 
## Part 2
 
Part 2 wants us to think differently about how our submarine works. The up down commands now modify a new property 'aim' then when we get forward command we need to change depth (y) as value * aim and also move forward.
 
So we can just have another variable 'aim' and modify it when we get up and down commands and change x and y when forward command occurs.
 
```
fn solve2(lines:&[&str]){
   let mut x :i32=0;
   let mut y :i32=0;
   let mut aim :i32=0;
   for line in lines{
       let mut tokens = line.split(' ');
       let command =tokens.next().unwrap();
       let val = tokens.next().unwrap().parse::<i32>().unwrap();
       if command =="forward"{
           x+=val;
           y+= (aim * val);
       }else if command =="up"{
           aim-=val;
       }else if command =="down"{
           aim+=val;
       }
   }
   println!("{}",x*y);
}
```
Here is our function which gave me the correct output for puzzle 2.
But we can do better and I think we should do better (again)
## Trying to do better
 
We can create an enum for the commands that we are supposed to get.
 
```
enum Command{
   Forward(i64),
   Up(i64),
   Down(i64),
}
```
Seems simple enough 3 types of commands and the value associated with it.
Now we need to write a function to parse a line "up 2" into a command.
 
```
impl Command{
   fn parse(s:&str)->Self{
       let words :Vec<&str> = s.trim().split_whitespace().collect();
       match words.as_slice(){
           ["forward",val]=> Command::Forward(val.parse().unwrap()),
           ["up",val]=> Command::Up(val.parse().unwrap()),
           ["down",val]=> Command::Down(val.parse().unwrap()),
           _ => panic!("This shouldn't happen."),
       }
   }
}
```
Now we can also create a struct submarine which has 2 properties x and y ( the 2D position)
 
```
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Submarine {
   x: i64,
   y: i64
}
```
 
Now we can write a 'new' function to generate a new submarine (sort of a constructor for OOP folks)
```
impl Submarine{
   fn new()-> Submarine{
       Submarine{
           x:0,
           y:0
       }
   }
}
```
Now we can use Submarine mySubmarine = Submarine::new();
to create new instances.
 
We can also write a function for submarine to handle commands
```
impl Submarine{
  fn operate(&mut self,command :Command){
     match command{
        Command::Up(value)=>{self.y-=value},
        Command::Down(value)=>{self.y+=value},
        Command::Forward(value)=>{self.x+=value},
     }
  }
}
```
Now we can parse our input file into commands and feed the commands into our submarine object commands like this
```
let mut submarine = Submarine::new();
  let commands = include_str!("input").lines().map(Command::parse).collect::<Vec<Command>>();
  for command in commands{
     submarine.operate(command)
  }
```
Now we have submarine.x and submarine.y as the coordinates.
 
But this is only for puzzle one. We can now write another function for puzzle 2 but we need to add another field to our submarine struct
```
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Submarine {
   x: i64,
   y: i64,
   aim: i64,
}
```
Now our new function can just simulate the actions accordingly
```
impl Submarine{
  fn operate_with_direction(&mut self, command: &Command) {
     match command {
        Command::Up(value) => self.aim -= value,
        Command::Down(value) => self.aim += value,
        Command::Forward(value) => {
           self.x += value;
           self.y += self.aim * value;
        }
     }
  }
}
```
 
There you go now we have all the required tools to solve both of our puzzles
```
fn main() {
   let mut submarine = Submarine::new();
   let mut submarine2 = Submarine::new();
 
   let commands = include_str!("input")
       .lines()
       .map(Command::parse)
       .collect::<Vec<Command>>();
   for command in commands {
       submarine.operate(&command);
       submarine2.operate_with_direction(&command);
   }
   println!("Puzzle 1: {}", submarine.x * submarine.y);
   println!("Puzzle 2: {}", submarine2.x * submarine2.y);
}
```
This concludes our code for day 2.
 
Thank you for reading this. If you see this post and think I really don't know what I am talking about you're 100% right. I just wanted to write about my journey through the AOC 2021 and hopefully I'll be able to achieve 50 stars.
